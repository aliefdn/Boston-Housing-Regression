# Boston-Housing-Regression

The data is about predicting housing price in Boston, MA. The data is already cleaned before, so I just need to develop the Machine Learning. I used Regression with Regulation by choosing between Ridge and LASSO method. I eveluate the best model on test data by using RMSE metric and give my own interpretation to my model. If you ever cross in here, please give me some feedback and comment to help me grow and develop my skills. 


Thank you! :bomb::triumph:
